# Threading Mystery 05 #

Do not look at the code yet!

Instead, compile and run the program:

```
> dotnet build
> dotnet run -- <variant> <number of factors>
```

where `<variant>` is one of

- `A`;
- `B`; or
- `C`.

Try different combinations:

- What does the program do?
- Can you see the variants behave differently?
- If yes, what do you think causes the differences?
