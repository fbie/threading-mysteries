# .NET Threading Mystery Classes #

Some C# classes that do mysterious threading things. They are intended to guide the discussion during the OTC knowledge sharing session on .NET threading.

## How to build and run ##

Please install the .NET SDK version 8:

- either by visiting the [download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0); or

Make sure that the `dotnet` executable is in your environment variables.

To test, run the following command from the root folder of this repository:

```

```

## Solve the Mysteries ##

Enter each mystery and run the compiled code using
